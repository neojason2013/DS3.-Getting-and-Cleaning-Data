	These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
	'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
	The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

	mean(): Mean value
	std(): Standard deviation

	value in each colume is the average of data for particular subject and activity.
